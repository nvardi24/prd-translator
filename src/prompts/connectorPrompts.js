Your task is to analyze the provided PRD and extract information to fill out this comprehensive template:

# üìã FILLABLE PRD REQUIREMENTS TABLE

**Connector:** [Extract connector name from PRD]

## Basic Information:

**Step-by-Step Analysis Process:**
- **Step 1 Research the API:** Understand the source system's capabilities before filling this out
- **Step 2 Brand Guidelines:** Ensure you have rights to use the connector's logo  
- **Step 3 Release Planning:** Align P0/P1 with overall product roadmap
- **Step 4 User Experience:** Write descriptions that help users understand what this connector does

| Field | Your Connector | Notes/Instructions |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Connector Name | [Extract name - becomes class name and constant] | e.g., "ServiceNow", "Confluence", "Box" |
| Connector Description | [Format: "Ingest [content type] from [Connector Name]"] | Appears in connector section UI |
| API Documentation URL | [Extract official API docs link if mentioned] | E.g.: https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ |
| P0 Release Target | [Extract P0 target if mentioned] | e.g., "260", "262" |
| P1 Release Target | [Next release after P0] | The one after P0 |
| Connector Icon/Logo | [Extract URL or note "Request from user"] | Helps UI selection |

## Authentication (Pick Primary + Optional Secondary)

**Determines how users will authenticate and what credentials they need to provide.**

**Step 1:** Research the API's authentication methods
- Check the API documentation for supported auth types
- Consider security requirements and user experience

**Step 2:** Select Primary Method (check ONE box)
- API Token: Simplest for users, good for SaaS platforms
- OAuth 2.0: Most secure, better for file systems and sensitive data
- Basic Auth: Simple but less secure, rarely used
- Custom: Only if none of the above work

**Step 3:** Map the auth fields to constants
- Field 1, 2, 3 become Java constants that developers use
- These constants must match what appears in the UI
- Keep yes or no in the selected column

| Auth Method | Selected | Auth Fields Required |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| API Token | [yes/no based on PRD] | Email, Token, URL |
| OAuth 2.0 | [yes/no based on PRD] | Client ID, Client Secret, (URL) |
| Basic Auth | [yes/no based on PRD] | Email, Password, URL |
| Custom | [yes/no based on PRD] | Specify: [Extract details if custom] |

**Primary Auth Fields:**
- Field 1: [Extract field name] - Requires validation ([yes/no based on PRD])
- Field 2: [Extract field name] - Requires validation ([yes/no based on PRD])
- Field 3: [Extract field name] - Requires validation ([yes/no based on PRD])

## Core Data Types (What will you retrieve?)

**Defines what content/data the connector will retrieve and process.**

- **Secondary Objects** = Supporting structure and metadata
  - Box: Comments (file discussions)
  - Zendesk: Categories, Sections (knowledge organization)
  - Jira: Users, Groups, Teams (project participants)  
- **Tertiary Objects** = Additional context and attachments
  - All connectors: Attachments (files linked to main content)
  - Jira: Dashboards, Sprints (project management tools)

| Data Category | Data Type | Priority | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|----------|-------|
