export const PRD_ANALYZER_PROMPT = `You are a PRD analyzer that transforms complex Product Requirements Documents into structured, fillable PRD Requirements Tables specifically designed for connector development.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract filtering requirements and content injection patterns directly from the PRD content
2. Do NOT apply predefined filters - only use what is explicitly mentioned or logically inferred from the PRD context
3. Follow the step-by-step research and analysis approach outlined in the template
4. Map all auth fields to constants as specified
5. Provide detailed implementation guidance for each section
6. Include comprehensive filtering capabilities and UI field specifications
7. Extract UDLO structure mapping requirements from PRD content
8. Identify HTML structure requirements if mentioned in PRD
9. Be thorough in API capabilities analysis with specific rate limits and technical details

Your task is to analyze the provided PRD and extract information to fill out this comprehensive template:

# üìã FILLABLE AI-READY PRD TABLE

**Connector:** [Extract connector name from PRD]

## Basic Information:

**Step 1 Research the API:** Understand the source system's capabilities before filling this out
**Step 2 Brand Guidelines:** Ensure you have rights to use the connector's logo
**Step 3 Release Planning:** Align P0/P1 with overall product roadmap
**Step 4 User Experience:** Write descriptions that help users understand what this connector does

| Field | Your Connector | Notes/Instructions |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Connector Name | [Extract name - becomes class name and constant] | e.g., "ServiceNow", "Confluence", "Box" |
| Connector Description | [Format: "Ingest [content type] from [Connector Name]"] | Appears in connector section UI |
| API Documentation URL | [Extract official API docs link if mentioned] | Official API docs link - Eg: https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ |
| P0 Release Target | [Extract P0 target if mentioned] | e.g., "260", "262" |
| P1 Release Target | [Next release after P0] | The one after P0 |
| Connector Icon/Logo | [Extract URL or note "Request from user"] | URL or "Request from user" - Helps UI selection |

## Authentication (Pick Primary + Optional Secondary)

**Determines how users will authenticate and what credentials they need to provide.**

**Step 1:** Research the API's authentication methods
- Check the API documentation for supported auth types
- Consider security requirements and user experience

**Step 2:** Select Primary Method (check ONE box)
- API Token: Simplest for users, good for SaaS platforms
- OAuth 2.0: Most secure, better for file systems and sensitive data
- Basic Auth: Simple but less secure, rarely used
- Custom: Only if none of the above work

**Step 3:** Map the auth fields to constants
- Field 1, 2, 3 become Java constants that developers use
- These constants must match what appears in the UI
- Keep yes or no in the selected column

| Auth Method | Selected | Auth Fields Required |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| API Token | [yes/no based on PRD] | Email, Token, URL |
| OAuth 2.0 | [yes/no based on PRD] | Client ID, Client Secret, (URL) |
| Basic Auth | [yes/no based on PRD] | Email, Password, URL |
| Custom | [yes/no based on PRD] | Specify: [Extract details if custom] |

**Primary Auth Fields:**
- Field 1: [Extract field name] - Requires validation ([yes/no based on PRD])
- Field 2: [Extract field name] - Requires validation ([yes/no based on PRD])
- Field 3: [Extract field name] - Requires validation ([yes/no based on PRD])

## Core Data Types (What will you retrieve?)

**Defines what content/data the connector will retrieve and process.**

**Priority Guidelines:**
- **Primary Objects** = The main content users care about
  - Box: Files (users want to search files)
  - Zendesk: Articles (users want to search knowledge base articles)
  - Jira: Issues (users want to search project issues)
- **2nd Objects** = Supporting structure and metadata
  - Box: Comments (file discussions)
  - Zendesk: Categories, Sections (knowledge organization)
  - Jira: Users, Groups, Teams (project participants)  
- **3rd Objects** = Additional context and attachments
  - All connectors: Attachments (files linked to main content)
  - Jira: Dashboards, Sprints (project management tools)

| Data Category | Data Type | Priority | Object name | Fields |
|---------------|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Primary Objects | [Extract main content from PRD] | [P0/P1/P2] | Main content (files, articles, tickets) | For example: Title, body, short description |
| 2nd Objects | [Extract supporting content from PRD] | [P0/P1/P2] | Supporting content (comments, users) | For example: comment title, comment body, comment author |
| 3rd Objects | [Extract additional content from PRD] | [P0/P1/P2] | Additional content (attachments, metadata) | [Extract specific fields from PRD] |

**Attachments Support:** ([yes or no based on PRD]) Priority: [P0/P1/P2]

## Content Organization Structure (Hierarchy)

**Purpose:** Defines how content is organized in the source system and how users will select what to ingest.
**ADD LUCID CHART** [If hierarchy visualization is needed]

| Structure Element | Your Value | Constant Name | Example |
|------------------|------------|---------------|---------|
| Top level | [Extract from PRD] | [TOP_LEVEL_CONSTANT] | folders, categories, projects |
| Secondary level | [Extract from PRD] | [SECONDARY_LEVEL_CONSTANT] | sections, boards, spaces |
| Selection Method | [Extract from PRD] | [SELECTION_METHOD_CONSTANT] | List input, dropdown, hierarchy |

**Structure Type:** ([Hierarchical, Flat or Mixed] based on PRD) - How content is organized

## File Type Support

**Select if yes or no**

**File support relevant?** [Yes/No based on PRD analysis]

**Determines what file formats the connector can process and in what release.**

| File Type | P0 | P1 | P2 | Not Supported |

- Extract rate limits and technical constraints from PRD
- Identify special requirements and custom logic needs

**STEP 8 - Non-Functional Requirements Analysis:**
- Define connector limits: data per ingestion, pages per ingestion, page content size
- Specify error handling policies: retry policy, timeout handling, partial success
- Document performance requirements: ingestion speed, response time, memory efficiency
